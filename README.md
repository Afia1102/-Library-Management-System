The Library Management System is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate efficient management of
library resources and interactions among administrators, students, and teachers. 
It includes login and signup screens tailored for each user type, along with dedicated view screens.
Administrators have user management rights, enabling them to view and manage registered teachers and students,
as well as add, edit, and search for books. Students and teachers can view the list of books, borrow them physically, 
and access their borrowing history. 
With intuitive features and streamlined functionalities, the system aims to enhance the library experience for all users.
